# Bioinformatics toolbox

This repository contains Python script I wrote while leraning about bioinformatics.
These scripts are ofter ugly and not optimized, because just written as POC or for quick testing.

## Conventions

+ The sequences are uppercase (`ACGT`, not `acgt`).
+ When talking about nucleotides, the order will always be `A`, `C`, `G` , `T` (alphabetical order).
For example, when there is an array of size 4 (one for each nucleotide), the first element
corresponds to `A`, the second to `C`, the third to `G` and the last one to `T`
